00:00.480 --> 00:01.200
Welcome back.

00:01.520 --> 00:08.240
In this video, I'm going to present you a demo and overview of the WhatsApp AI, customer support and

00:08.240 --> 00:12.320
low ticket sales agent and explain how it works node by node.

00:12.720 --> 00:15.680
And at the end, I've got a task for you.

00:16.200 --> 00:22.440
After watching the video, please download the workflow and try to connect all the credentials and modify

00:22.440 --> 00:23.800
this solution to your needs.

00:24.040 --> 00:29.680
If you have been following this course lesson by lesson, you should already have most of the required

00:29.680 --> 00:39.160
accounts connected like WhatsApp, OpenAI, or Google Drive, so you can simply click on a specific

00:39.160 --> 00:45.920
node and choose the account you want to connect, for example, Google Drive and so on.

00:51.200 --> 00:57.840
Now, just to remind you, you can manage all your credentials in this section for each project separately.

00:58.640 --> 01:03.240
So just go to credentials and you can manage all your accounts right here.

01:04.770 --> 01:11.570
However, as I mentioned in one of the previous lessons, some platforms like WhatsApp may require you

01:11.570 --> 01:17.010
to refresh your credentials from time to time and re-enter the API keys manually.

01:17.170 --> 01:23.330
Also, you have not used Google Gemini in any of the previous projects, so if you are stuck setting

01:23.330 --> 01:30.450
that up or need help connecting any platform, feel free to go to the dedicated section on setting up

01:30.450 --> 01:31.330
credentials.

01:31.650 --> 01:37.970
Next in this project, we'll be using Supabase vector database to give our WhatsApp agent long term

01:37.970 --> 01:38.530
memory.

01:39.090 --> 01:44.370
So to find out exactly how to use Supabase, configure everything and complete the setup.

01:44.770 --> 01:50.290
Please refer to the next lesson called How to Build an Agent That Remembers Everything.

01:50.330 --> 01:52.970
Where I will show you step by step how to do it.

01:53.250 --> 01:54.690
Alright, now it's your turn.

01:55.210 --> 01:56.690
Watch the rest of this video.

01:57.370 --> 01:59.530
Download and import the workflow.

01:59.690 --> 02:03.650
Connect all your accounts and make this WhatsApp agent your own.

02:04.090 --> 02:06.490
Alright guys, so let's do a quick demonstration.

02:07.130 --> 02:16.260
So I trained my WhatsApp I agent using my company's information like the services we offer using the

02:16.260 --> 02:17.660
first part of the workflow.

02:19.140 --> 02:27.700
So now when I click on the workflow, it's waiting for the trigger to fire in the second part of the

02:27.700 --> 02:28.300
workflow.

02:29.220 --> 02:29.940
With this one.

02:34.420 --> 02:36.020
So let's simulate a message.

02:36.420 --> 02:41.820
Imagine a client type something like what services do you offer?

02:51.500 --> 02:52.740
And as you can see.

02:55.940 --> 02:57.300
The workflow has been triggered.

02:58.660 --> 03:04.060
And now agent is working on a response to the user.

03:07.700 --> 03:13.640
And yeah adaptive AI offers a range of services designed to enhance business operations and customer

03:13.640 --> 03:15.480
engagement, including etc..

03:17.800 --> 03:26.880
So basically the agent created a response using the information stored in a base vector store.

03:29.120 --> 03:36.160
And this is where we pulled all the details from the word file that we pulled from Google Drive using

03:36.160 --> 03:39.400
the first part of the workflow.

03:40.440 --> 03:46.920
This one, and this is the fourth file in Google Drive.

03:48.360 --> 03:48.560
Okay.

03:48.600 --> 03:51.600
So now let's test the voice message feature.

03:52.720 --> 03:54.520
So click on the test workflow.

03:57.320 --> 03:59.040
And I'm going to ask the same question.

03:59.480 --> 04:00.760
What services do you offer.

04:06.440 --> 04:10.080
And we should receive similar response from our agent.

04:20.730 --> 04:23.530
It takes like ten, 15 seconds.

04:25.930 --> 04:26.130
Yeah.

04:26.170 --> 04:29.610
As you can see, adaptive AI provides a variety of services, including.

04:30.290 --> 04:36.530
In this video, I will walk you through how to set up a WhatsApp AI agent that's trained on your company's

04:36.530 --> 04:39.290
data and can retain conversation history.

04:39.850 --> 04:44.490
So you can set up, set this up for yourself, or even sell it for your clients.

04:44.610 --> 04:51.050
So this agent can handle text and voice messages and retrieve relevant information, and then reply

04:51.090 --> 04:54.530
naturally by keeping the context of the conversation.

04:55.210 --> 04:56.410
So let's get started.

04:58.730 --> 05:02.250
So this is the first part of the workflow.

05:03.650 --> 05:09.210
And the workflow starts with when clicking the test workflow node.

05:09.890 --> 05:16.730
And this is manual trigger that lets you test the setup by running the workflow on demand.

05:18.130 --> 05:21.340
Next we have uh, the Google Drive node.

05:22.380 --> 05:26.500
So this node downloads a file from a specific Google Drive folder.

05:26.500 --> 05:31.500
So you can select which document you want to process and store in the database.

05:32.180 --> 05:39.540
So this is where your company's documents, like PDFs or word files are retrieved for further processing.

05:41.740 --> 05:42.140
Um.

05:44.820 --> 05:45.460
Next.

05:45.660 --> 05:51.940
Once the file is retrieved, uh it's passed to Supabase vector store node.

05:51.940 --> 05:56.620
So here, uh, the queue is stored as part of your knowledge base.

05:57.100 --> 06:03.380
So this step ensures that the data is available for processing in the next steps.

06:04.660 --> 06:12.940
So after storing, uh, after storing the workflow moves to recursive characters.

06:13.060 --> 06:15.380
Uh splitter text splitter node.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.860
So this splits the document into smaller chunks.

06:19.060 --> 06:26.550
And splitting is crucial because AI models Perform better with smaller, structured, structured pieces

06:26.550 --> 06:27.190
of text.

06:28.310 --> 06:33.350
So next up the default data loader node.

06:33.350 --> 06:39.790
So it organizes the text chunks and ensures they're ready for embedding.

06:39.790 --> 06:43.470
So this step format the data for smooth processing.

06:45.550 --> 06:50.310
After formatting the chunks are passed to the embeddings OpenAI node.

06:50.870 --> 07:00.070
So this node generates a numerical embeddings for each chunk of text, making it easier to compare and

07:00.070 --> 07:02.390
retrieve relevant information later.

07:03.470 --> 07:08.350
And finally, the embeddings are sent back to the base vector store.

07:09.270 --> 07:15.950
So these embeddings are stored in the database and creates a searchable vector store.

07:16.390 --> 07:23.430
So this is essential for enabling enabling your AI to retrieve the right information when queried.

07:26.910 --> 07:29.480
So this is the second part of the workflow.

07:30.360 --> 07:33.960
So the workflow starts with the WhatsApp trigger node.

07:35.000 --> 07:43.000
This listens for incoming messages like texts or audio and from from your clients on WhatsApp.

07:44.000 --> 07:44.640
One.

07:44.680 --> 07:50.080
Once a message is received, it moves on to the next steps in the workflow.

07:50.920 --> 07:55.080
So the trigger connects to a split out message pass node.

07:55.080 --> 08:00.960
So this node checks whether the incoming messages, uh, is text or audio.

08:01.960 --> 08:13.000
So if the message is uh, an audio, uh, it's passed to the get audio URL and download uh audio nodes.

08:13.640 --> 08:25.680
So this nodes uh fetch and download the audio file file and then uh Google Gemini audio node uh processes

08:25.680 --> 08:28.720
it to transcribe the voice into text.

08:29.720 --> 08:31.260
So Transcription.

08:31.300 --> 08:37.660
Tenants voice messages into text so the AI can process them like regular text messages.

08:39.940 --> 08:40.540
Next.

08:40.780 --> 08:47.060
Once the message is transcribed, or if it's already text, it goes to the Getusers message node.

08:47.420 --> 08:54.180
And this node organizes and formats the message, pulling out important details like the type of message,

08:54.180 --> 08:56.220
the text content, and who sent it.

08:56.820 --> 09:03.420
So it extracts the sender's phone number and message text so they are ready to use in the next steps.

09:04.540 --> 09:13.540
So the information go to AI in this case is AI tools agent.

09:14.420 --> 09:19.260
So next the Postgres chat memory node comes into play.

09:19.380 --> 09:26.020
And this node lets the AI remember the conversation history, including previous messages and context

09:26.340 --> 09:28.900
like the client's name or earlier questions.

09:29.340 --> 09:37.310
So this basically this makes for follow up questions easy to handle without the client needing to repeat

09:37.310 --> 09:37.950
themselves.

09:38.310 --> 09:40.830
And it keeps the interaction feeling natural.

09:41.630 --> 09:45.910
So now we move to supervised vector store.

09:46.510 --> 09:53.150
Uh, this is where the agent searches your company's knowledge base to find the most relevant information.

09:53.670 --> 09:57.150
So it works with, uh, embeddings.

09:57.270 --> 10:06.070
OpenAI model, um, to match the client's questions, to stored knowledge and pull up the best possible

10:06.070 --> 10:06.550
answer.

10:07.310 --> 10:13.870
So after gathering all the data, the OpenAI chat model node, uh, generates response.

10:13.910 --> 10:21.070
Uh, it combines the client's question and the retrieved knowledge and the conversation history to create

10:21.070 --> 10:22.830
a helpful and natural reply.

10:23.910 --> 10:28.950
And the final step is to reply to the, uh, user node.

10:30.590 --> 10:35.990
This sends the response back to the client through WhatsApp.
